### Research summary
My research activities span from plant and animal breeding & genetics, to bioinformatics and biostatistics applications in plant & animal science and human medicine. 
I worked for the breeding industry, for universities and research centres and for international organizations in many places: 
Italy, Ireland, Canada, The Netherlands, Germany, Spain, Madagascar, The United Kingdom, Belgium.
I am now Senior Scientist at CNR. Currently, I have rejoined my research group in Milan after being seconded for two years at the Data Analysis Team of the ERC (European Research Council).
Current projects include: deep neural network models for image, sound, text and tabular data in (semi)supervised and unsupervised problems; machine learning methods for the prediction of GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions from dairy farms; measuring the accuracy of imputing missing genetic variants in diploid genomes under challenging scenarios; using environmental descriptors ("enviromics") to model GxE (genotype by environment) interactions in genomic predictions; GWAS for survival to covid-19 in a large integrated heterogeneous dataset; developing methods and tools to detect and interpret runs of homozygosity (ROH) and heterozygosity-rich regions (HRR) in diploid genomes.

#### Research topics

- Statistics, machine and deep learning: explore the boundaries of predictions
- GHG emissions from agriculture: tools for predictions and monitoring emissions, strategies for reduction and mitigation
- Imputation of missing data: methods, accuracy and scenarios for the imputation of any type of missing data (not only genotypes!)
- Computer vision: methods and applications in agriculture and medicine
- Biomarkers discovery and precision medicine
- The role of microbiome in animals, plants, humans, food and environments
- Antimicrobial resistance in farm animals: approaches to reduce or replace the use of antimicrobials in farm animals
- Genotype-by-environment interactions in plant and animal breeding: more accurate and robust predictions, adaptation of populations to changing climate and environments
- GWAS: methods and applications
- Genomics: structure, distribution and practical applications of homozygous and heterozygos regions in diploid genomes (ROH, HRR)
- Plant and animal breeding: increase yield, sustainability and production efficiency in farm animals and crops (any ploidy)
