### Research summary
My research activities span from plant and animal breeding & genetics, to bioinformatics and biostatistics applications in plant & animal science and human medicine. 
I worked for the breeding industry, for universities and research centres and for international organizations in many places: 
Italy, Ireland, Canada, The Netherlands, Germany, Spain, Madagascar, The United Kingdom, Belgium.
I am now Senior Scientist at CNR. Currently, I have rejoined my research group in Milan after being seconded for two years at the Data Analysis Team of the ERC (European Research Council).
Current projects include: deep neural network models for image, sound, text and tabular data in (semi)supervised and unsupervised problems; machine learning methods for the prediction of GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions from dairy farms; measuring the accuracy of imputing missing genetic variants in diploid genomes under challenging scenarios; using environmental descriptors ("enviromics") to model GxE (genotype by environment) interactions in genomic predictions; GWAS for survival to covid-19 in a large integrated heterogeneous dataset; developing methods and tools to detect and interpret runs of homozygosity (ROH) and heterozygosity-rich regions (HRR) in diploid genomes.
